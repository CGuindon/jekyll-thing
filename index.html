		<h2>A small peek into my life…</h2>
		
		<p>I was born and raised in Ottawa, Canada and attended French schools until the age of 18, making me completely bilingual.  Luckily, my parents enjoyed venturing away from home for short periods, which allowed my sister and I to get a first glimpse of travelling —now my favourite pass time.  This led to very organized but successful trips around Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Egypt.  I have yet to accomplish my goal of stepping at least one foot in every country.  My second lifetime goal is to live through my 112th birthday (officially living in 3 different centuries).  This means I have the next 87 years to create pieces of beauty that will be seen in everyday life.  How will I do this? By using my many talents as a graphic designer.</p>
